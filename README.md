# TSA_Complaints
This article uses the TSA complaint data to help put together useful travel pointers that can help guide their next trip. These include potential issues they may see at the top 10 airports in the US as well as some ways to manage these potential issues.

### Overview: 
This analysis examines TSA complaints across major U.S. airports, focusing on the top 10 busiest locations. Using datasets on complaint categories, subcategories, and airport-specific trends, we visualized complaint patterns over time through heatmaps, custom visuals, and spatial maps. Key areas of concern, such as customer service and expedited passenger screening, were analyzed to identify trends and potential areas for improvement in passenger experience.

### Key Findings:
* Expedited Passenger Screening Program 
  * Had the highest number of complaints out of all categories.
  * Extreme increase in complaint rate in 2021 likely due to new technology being implemented.
* COVID Effect
  * Low rates of complaints in 2020.
